Insurance claim processing is one of the most document-heavy tasks in the financial services industry. Each claim involves submission of forms, bills, certificates, RC copies, repair estimates, and various supporting documents. These documents differ greatly in format across insurers, often containing a mix of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
Manual review of claims is slow, prone to human error, and resource-intensive. Moreover, variability in document structures adds to the complexity.
The Insurance Claim Document Summarizer addresses this challenge by automating document parsing, extracting key information, and generating concise structured summaries. It leverages regex-based extraction rules, OCR for scanned inputs, and quantized Mistral 7B LLM for cleaning ambiguous text. The application supports Motor, Life, and Health Insurance and provides outputs in multiple export formats.
